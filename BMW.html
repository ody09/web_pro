BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities 
were banned from producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. Again, the company survived 
by making pots, pans, and bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed car 
production in Bavaria in 1952 with the BMW 501 luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955,
through the production of the cheaper Isetta microcar under licence. Slow sales of luxury cars and
small profit margins from microcars, meant BMW was in serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company 
was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz.
A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a 
separate entity. GÃ¼nther Quandt, was a well-known German industrialist, joined the Nazi party in 1933
and made a fortune arming the German Wehrmacht, manufacturing weapons and batteries.[10] Many of his
enterprises were appropriated from Jewish owners under duress with minimal compensation. At least three 
of his enterprises made extensive use of slave laborers, as many as 50,000 in all.[11] One of his battery 
factories had its own on-site concentration camp, complete with gallows. Life expectancy for laborers was six
months.[11][12] While Quandt and BMW were not directly connected during the war, funds amassed in the Nazi era
by his father allowed Herbert Quandt to buy BMW.
